# reso

## Overview

reso is a social-first, AI-native music discovery platform that connects users through shared musical interests and personalized recommendations. The platform leverages Next.js and React to create a seamless, responsive experience that integrates with popular music streaming services.

Using AI algorithms, reso analyzes listening patterns to suggest new music that bridges users' preferences, expanding their musical horizons. The application creates a dedicated space for musical connection between users, serving as both a discovery tool and a social platform for music enthusiasts.

## Core Features

- **Daily AI-Curated Recommendations** - Each day, the app presents personalized music suggestions that align with user preferences, with AI-generated explanations of why the selection might appeal based on listening history
- **Social Music Profiles** - Users can create profiles showcasing their music taste, favorite genres, and listening statistics, enabling connections with others who share similar interests
- **Music Sharing & Reactions** - Send songs directly to friends with context or reactions, creating a dedicated music messaging channel separate from regular social platforms
- **Collaborative Playlists** - Create and contribute to shared playlists with friends, with AI assistance to suggest tracks that fit the playlist's vibe and appeal to all contributors

## Technical Architecture

- Next.js application with API routes for backend functionality, leveraging the App Router for optimized client and server-side rendering
- Prisma ORM with a relational database for storing user profiles, preferences, and social connections, with efficient TypeScript integration
- RESTful and GraphQL APIs for flexible data fetching and integration with music streaming services
- React Query for optimized data fetching, caching, and state management across the application
