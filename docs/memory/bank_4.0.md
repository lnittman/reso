# reso Memory Bank - v4.0

## Project Status Update

The reso project has evolved into a focused AI-native music discovery and social playlist platform. Through the development process, we've made critical architectural decisions that align with our core value proposition:

1. **Core Value Definition**
   - Shifted focus to AI-powered playlist generation and social sharing
   - Eliminated direct media playback in favor of integration with existing streaming services
   - Emphasized legal compliance by focusing on metadata and playlist creation

2. **Component Development**
   - Created a dynamic home feed showcasing both AI recommendations and social activity
   - Built a comprehensive AI playlist generator with customization options
   - Implemented collaborative playlist features emphasizing social interaction

3. **UI/UX Refinement**
   - Implemented a tabbed interface to separate AI recommendations, social feeds, and discovery
   - Created card-based layouts for visual consistency across the application
   - Added visual elements to clearly communicate AI-powered features

4. **Technical Improvements**
   - Removed unnecessary player components to focus on core functionality
   - Fixed client/server component issues by adding proper "use client" directives
   - Implemented proper state management for AI-generated playlist parameters

## Current Project Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture organized around key features:

1. **Pages**
   - `app/page.tsx`: Main landing page with tabs for For You, Friends, and Discover content
   - `app/playlists/generate/page.tsx`: AI playlist generator page
   - `app/playlists/collaborative/page.tsx`: Collaborative playlist management
   - Additional pages for user profile, auth, etc.

2. **Components**
   - **Music Discovery**: `DailyRecommendations.tsx`, `TrackCard.tsx`
   - **AI Generation**: `AIPlaylistGenerator.tsx` with mood, genre, and era selection
   - **Social Components**: Collaborative playlist cards, activity feeds

3. **State Management**
   - Using Zustand for global state management (removed player store)
   - Local component state for forms and UI interactions
   - Ready for integration with backend APIs

4. **API Layer**
   - Added `/api/playlists/ai-generate` for AI playlist generation
   - Added `/api/playlists/export` for streaming service export
   - Structured for proper validation and error handling

5. **External Integration**
   - Created utilities for OpenAI API integration with prompt engineering
   - Added streaming service integration with deep linking and embedding
   - Implemented mock data fallbacks for development

## Implemented Features in Detail

### 1. AI Playlist Generation

We've implemented a comprehensive AI playlist generation system with the following components:

1. **OpenAI Integration (`/src/lib/ai/openai.ts`)**
   - Created interfaces for playlist generation parameters and responses
   - Implemented prompt engineering with customizable parameters
   - Added mock data generation for development without API keys

   - Need to standardize component props and properly type functions

2. **Authentication**
   - Currently using mock data without actual authentication
   - Need to implement proper NextAuth setup

3. **Deployment**
   - Turbopack errors need to be addressed
   - Environment variable management needs improvement

## Next Immediate Tasks

1. ✅ Begin LLM integration by creating the API utility functions
2. ✅ Create the server-side API route for playlist generation
3. ✅ Connect the frontend AIPlaylistGenerator to the API
4. ✅ Implement basic streaming service integration for playlist export

5. Address TypeScript linter errors in components
