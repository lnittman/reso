   - Implement NextAuth.js for user authentication
   - Set up OAuth providers (Google, Spotify, Apple Music)
   - Create protected routes and authentication middleware

3. **API Routes**
   - Implement core API routes as outlined in init.md:
     - User management (/api/users/*)
     - Recommendations (/api/recommendations)
     - Playlists (/api/playlists/*)
     - Sharing functionality (/api/share/*)

### Phase 2: Music Service Integration (2-3 Weeks)

1. **Streaming Service Connectors**
   - Implement Spotify Web API integration

2. **Player Functionality**
   - Connect player controls to actual streaming services
   - Implement continuous playback with proper error handling
   - Add features like shuffle, repeat, queue management

3. **Music Data Management**
   - Create data fetching hooks with React Query
   - Implement caching strategy for music metadata
   - Set up background data syncing for offline capabilities

### Phase 3: AI Recommendation Engine (3-4 Weeks)

1. **Data Collection Pipeline**
   - Implement user activity tracking for listening patterns
   - Create analytics events for user interactions
   - Design data structures for recommendation algorithms

2. **Recommendation Algorithms**
   - Implement collaborative filtering as described in tech.md
   - Create content-based recommendation system using track features
   - Develop hybrid approach combining multiple algorithms

3. **Explanation Generation**
   - Implement natural language generation for recommendations
   - Create templates for different recommendation types
   - Set up feedback mechanism to improve explanations

### Phase 4: Social Features (2-3 Weeks)

1. **User Profiles**
   - Complete user profile pages with actual data
   - Implement following/follower functionality
   - Add activity feeds for social interactions

2. **Sharing Mechanisms**
   - Implement direct song sharing between users
   - Create reaction system for shared content
   - Add commenting and contextual sharing

3. **Collaborative Features**
   - Implement collaborative playlists
   - Add real-time collaboration with WebSockets
   - Create activity tracking for collaborative actions

### Phase 5: Refinement & Optimization (Ongoing)

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement proper code splitting
   - Optimize image loading and media handling
   - Improve API response times and caching

2. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Set up unit testing for critical components
   - Implement integration tests for key user flows
   - Create end-to-end tests for core functionality

3. **Accessibility & Internationalization**
   - Ensure WCAG compliance for all components
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Set up i18n for multiple language support

## Technical Debt & Improvements

1. **Type Safety**
   - Resolve TypeScript linter errors in components
   - Properly type Zustand stores and their methods
   - Create comprehensive type definitions for API responses

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Create user-friendly error states for components
   - Set up error logging and monitoring

3. **Documentation**
   - Document component API and usage patterns
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Update technical documentation with implementation details

## Implementation Strategy

The project should follow an iterative approach with these guidelines:

1. **Feature Branches**
   - Create feature branches for each major component
   - Implement comprehensive testing for each feature
   - Review code before merging to main

2. **Weekly Milestones**
   - Set clear weekly goals for feature completion
   - Conduct regular progress reviews
   - Adjust timeline based on challenges encountered

3. **User Testing**
   - Implement early user testing for core features
   - Collect feedback on UX and recommendation quality
   - Iterate based on user insights

## Resources & Dependencies

Key resources for implementation:

1. **APIs & Services**
   - Spotify Web API (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
   - NextAuth.js (https://next-auth.js.org/)
   - Prisma ORM (https://www.prisma.io/docs)

2. **AI & Recommendation**
   - TensorFlow.js for client-side models
   - Recommendation system libraries (surprise, implicit)
   - Natural language generation tools

3. **Frontend Tools**
   - React Query for data fetching
   - Framer Motion for animations
   - Tailwind CSS for styling

## Conclusion

The reso project has established a solid foundation with a working frontend implementation. The next phases focus on connecting the frontend to backend services, implementing core functionality for music discovery, and building out the social features that differentiate the platform.

By following this roadmap, the project can systematically build out the features outlined in the documentation while maintaining high-quality code and user experience throughout the development process.
