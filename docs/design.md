## Introduction

reso is a social-first, AI-native music discovery platform that connects users through shared musical interests and personalized recommendations. This design system document outlines the UI/UX guidelines and principles that ensure a consistent, intuitive, and engaging user experience across the platform.

Our design approach emphasizes the social connections formed through music while leveraging AI capabilities to enhance discovery and personalization. The interface is crafted to be both visually appealing and highly functional, making music exploration and sharing a seamless experience.

## Design Principles

### Connection-Focused
Design elements should facilitate and highlight connections between users and their music preferences. Visual cues should emphasize shared musical interests and potential new connections.

### Intelligent Simplicity
While the AI technology powering recommendations is complex, the interface should present these sophisticated features in an intuitive and approachable manner.

### Musical Expression
The design should reflect the emotional and expressive nature of music through visual elements, animations, and interactive components.

### Responsive Engagement
Interface elements should provide meaningful feedback and adapt to user behavior, creating a dynamic experience that feels personalized and responsive.

### Accessible Discovery
Music discovery features should be easily accessible throughout the application, encouraging exploration while maintaining a coherent navigation structure.

## Color System

## Layout & Grid

### Responsive Grid System
- **Desktop**: 12-column grid with 24px gutters
- **Tablet**: 8-column grid with 16px gutters
- **Mobile**: 4-column grid with 16px gutters

### Spacing System
Based on an 8px increment system:
- **xs**: 4px
- **sm**: 8px
- **md**: 16px
- **lg**: 24px
- **xl**: 32px
- **xxl**: 48px
- **xxxl**: 64px

### Container Hierarchy
- **Primary containers**: Full-width sections with 24px padding on desktop, 16px on mobile
- **Secondary containers**: Rounded corners (12px radius), with inner padding of 16px
- **Cards**: 8px radius with 16px padding, subtle elevation shadow

### Layout Patterns
- **Feed Layout**: Vertical scrolling list for music recommendations and social activity
- **Grid Layout**: For displaying album collections, playlists, and artist galleries
- **Split Layout**: For comparison views and collaborative playlist building

## Components

### Navigation Components
- **Main Navigation Bar**: Fixed position, contains logo, search, profile, and primary actions
- **Tab Bar**: Used for switching between major sections (Discover, Library, Social)

- **Bottom Sheet**: Mobile navigation for quick actions and playback controls

### Music Player Components
- **Mini Player**: Persistent compact player showing current track with basic controls
- **Expanded Player**: Full-screen immersive player with album art, lyrics, and advanced controls
- **Queue Manager**: Draggable list of upcoming tracks with reordering capability
- **Playback Controls**: Consistent design for play/pause, skip, volume across all player variants

### Social Components

- Consistent class naming conventions for custom components

### Responsive Strategy
- Mobile-first approach to CSS and component design
- Strategic breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px
- Fluid typography and spacing that scales with viewport

### State Management
- React Query for server state management
- Context API for UI state and theme preferences
- Local component state for isolated interactions

### Animation Implementation
- Framer Motion for complex animations and transitions
- CSS transitions for simple hover and focus states
- Controlled animation timing to maintain performance

## Integration with Music Streaming Services

### Authentication Flows
